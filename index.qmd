Welcome to my website!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change](https://wegcenter.uni-graz.at/en/) at the [University of Graz](https://www.uni-graz.at/en/). I am an economist, working on topics in environmental and spatial economics.

<summary>Abstract</summary>

This paper explores the spatial spillover effects of water scarcity on local economic activity and examines the role of irrigation in modulating these effects. Utilizing a newly assembled global geospatial data set that combines information on seasonal water availability and economic activity measured by nighttime luminosity, I conduct a spatial econometric analysis at the granular level of 0.25° x 0.25° grid cells worldwide. My results reveal that agricultural water scarcity in rainfed grid cells has negative spatial spillover effects on economic activity, extending up to 300 kilometers away. However, the presence of irrigation infrastructure effectively mitigates both the direct negative impacts and the negative spatial spillover effects of agricultural water scarcity on economic activity. These results suggest that the benefits of certain climate adaptation measures may not be confined locally, but are observable at a larger scale. This paper emphasizes the importance of considering spatial dynamics and irrigation in understanding the effects of water scarcity on economic activity, providing valuable insights for water resource management policies targeted at promoting climate-resilient development.

<summary>Abstract</summary>

Growing evidence suggests that there is a causal effect of rainfall on economic output, yet the mechanisms driving these effects remain unclear. Here, by integrating gridded agricultural information, climate data, and information on economic output for 1,541 subnational regions across 77 countries, I show that agriculture is the primary driver of the effect of rainfall on overall economic output growth. Specifically, I find that economic output growth declines when subnational regions experience anomalous rainfall during the agricultural growing season, while exposure to anomalous rainfall during the non-growing season has no effect. Dry growing season conditions are particularly harmful, and previous studies that do not account for seasonal rainfall patterns significantly underestimate these effects. I find evidence that the effects on economic growth rates are persistent and that rising income levels reduce the vulnerability to growing season rainfall anomalies. These results deliver empirical evidence that agriculture is driving the negative effects of dry conditions on economic growth rates, especially in low- to middle-income regions.
